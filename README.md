How do you know what to give loved ones? How do you know someone else hasn't already gifted the same thing you are wanting to give?

## HTML
The calendar isn't as bad as they say. The default isn't bad.

## Things I learned from the Simon assignment and the html assignments
- Be deliberate with your html tags. There's a specific purpose, structure, and hierarchy.
- Make changes often, deploy often.
- Make smaller commits
