## HTML
The calendar isn't as bad as they say. The default isn't bad.

## Things I learned from the Simon assignment and the html assignments
- Be deliberate with your html tags. There's a specific purpose, structure, and hierarchy.
- Make changes often, deploy often.
- Make smaller commits

## Javascript Simon
- Adding onClick events initialized the js, you can then add the .js at the bottom of the page.

## Startup JS Take-Aways
- As for now, local storage is where the data is stored, but that will change.
- Using the constructor in a class to set the default state of the app is really helpful.
- Some instances the event listener needs to be added in the html.

## Node
- include node-modules in .gitignore

## Simon Service
- make sure and update your gitignore for your startup applicaiton
- your deployService sh file has changed. Make sure and run the chmod on the file to make it accessible.
- Simon app had a cool calc for the height "height: calc(100px + 1em);" in the css file.
- your index js files don't speak to each other from the front end and backend.
- make sure your index file has the correct folder name passed in for express.static for your static files.
- what the class video two more times.
- Simon is listening ono 3000, but your app will be on 4000.
