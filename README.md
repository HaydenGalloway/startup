## HTML
The calendar isn't as bad as they say. The default isn't bad.

## Things I learned from the Simon assignment and the html assignments
- Be deliberate with your html tags. There's a specific purpose, structure, and hierarchy.
- Make changes often, deploy often.
- Make smaller commits

## Javascript Simon
- Adding onClick events initialized the js, you can then add the .js at the bottom of the page.

## Startup JS Take-Aways
- As for now, local storage is where the data is stored, but that will change.
- Using the constructor in a class to set the default state of the app is really helpful.
- Some instances the event listener needs to be added in the html.
